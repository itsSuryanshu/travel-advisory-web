# Travel Advisory Web

## Overview
The actual Canadian travel advisories page provides Canadians with a rather long list of countries and their advisory levels which are categorized into 4 levels: Normal Precautions, Increased Caution, Reconsider Travel, and Do Not Travel. Browsing through this long list of countries can be time-consuming especially when the destination is not decided yet.
Therefore, I created a web application that provides Canadian travel advisories in a user-friendly format by utilizing interactive choropleth maps and a few cool tricks that make it easier to find the information you need!
